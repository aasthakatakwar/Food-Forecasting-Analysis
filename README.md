# Food-Forecasting-Analysis
This project is a data analysis and visualization project using Tableau to explore the level of demand in each fulfillment center, with a granular focus on product information. The analysis provides insights into which fulfillment areas are performing well and which are not, with additional nuance added through center-meal combinations.
