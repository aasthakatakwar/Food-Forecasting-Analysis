# Food-Forecasting-Analysis
This project is a data analysis and visualization project using Tableau to explore the level of demand in each fulfillment center, with a granular focus on product information. The analysis provides insights into which fulfillment areas are performing well and which are not, with additional nuance added through center-meal combinations.

Problem Statement: 
The client is a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. They have various
fulfilment centres in these cities for dispatching meal orders to their customers. The client
wants to help these centres with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that these 
centres will plan the stock of raw materials accordingly.
The replenishment of most raw materials is done on a weekly basis and since the raw material 
is perishable, procurement planning is of utmost importance. Secondly, staffing of the centres 
is also one area wherein accurate demand forecasts are really helpful. 
We have the below information with us in the form of 3 different datasets: Historical data of demand for a product-centre combination, Product (Meal) features such as category, sub-category, current price, and discount, Information for fulfilment centres like centre area, city information, etc.
The dataset required has been provided along with this document.
Here is a story in Tableau that talks about the level of demand in each
centre. This analysis is granular enough to include product information as well. The
client wants an end-to-end report to understand which fulfilment areas are doing well and
which aren't.
